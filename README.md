# Modeling Evolutionary Processes in Complex Biological Systems with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Modeling Evolutionary Processes in Complex Biological Systems with Machine Learning**, aims to simulate evolutionary processes within biological systems using machine learning models. We utilize an ensemble approach, integrating several models to achieve a comprehensive view of genetic variation, trait evolution, and the survival of the fittest.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Modeling Evolution**: To simulate evolutionary processes based on real-world genetic datasets, allowing insights into how genetic traits are passed down and modified over generations.
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use an ensemble of machine learning models to predict evolutionary outcomes and measure model performance across various genetic scenarios.
3. **Metrics and Performance Evaluation**: Apply various performance metrics to analyze and compare models, ensuring robust results and reliable predictions.

## System Design

This project is structured to efficiently load data, process it, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The models work collaboratively to improve accuracy in predicting evolutionary outcomes based on genetic traits and environmental factors.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - **DataLoader**: This module loads and preprocesses datasets, cleans missing data, and splits it into training, testing, and validation sets. It also handles categorical variables and encodes them for model compatibility.
   - **Preprocessing**: The data normalization process scales features to ensure that all input variables contribute equally to the model training. Feature extraction focuses on key genetic traits relevant to the evolutionary analysis.

2. **Model Training**:
   - **Ensemble Models**: We use an ensemble of machine learning models to predict evolutionary patterns and outcomes. The models include:
     - **Random Forest**: A decision-tree-based model that reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees, making it effective in capturing nonlinear relationships in the data.
     - **XGBoost**: A gradient-boosted decision tree that improves accuracy through a boosting mechanism that sequentially corrects errors made by previous models.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: This model identifies optimal hyperplanes to separate different evolutionary outcomes in the feature space, allowing for effective classification.
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN clusters genetic data by identifying local neighbors, making it useful for understanding variations within specific populations.
     - **Neural Network (NN)**: A deep learning model that processes high-dimensional genetic data through multiple layers, capturing complex relationships and patterns.

3. **Evaluation and Metrics**:
   - **Evaluation.ipynb**: This module calculates various metrics to evaluate model performance:
     - **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, providing a basic understanding of model performance.
     - **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: These metrics offer deeper insights into the model’s performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets where some classes may dominate.
     - **ROC-AUC**: Assesses how well the model distinguishes between evolutionary categories (e.g., beneficial vs. non-beneficial mutations) by evaluating the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: A visual representation that shows the correct vs. incorrect predictions, helping to identify specific areas of improvement for the models.
     - **Cross-Validation**: Ensures robustness of the models by evaluating performance across different subsets of the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Visualization.py**: This module generates plots such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and trait distribution over time. Visualization aids in understanding model performance and the trends in evolutionary changes across generations.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - **GridSearchCV**: Used to systematically explore the hyperparameter space for each model, ensuring optimal settings are identified to maximize model performance.

6. **Ensemble Voting Mechanism**:
   - The ensemble model combines predictions from all models to improve the overall prediction accuracy. By taking a weighted vote from individual models, it reduces variance and enhances robustness, allowing for more reliable predictions.

2. **Train Models**:
   Use `model.ipynb` to train the models on the dataset. The script handles hyperparameter optimization automatically using GridSearchCV, returning the trained models along with their optimal parameters.

3. **Evaluate Models**:
   Use `evaluation.ipynb` to calculate all key performance metrics and evaluate how well the ensemble model is performing. This will generate a report summarizing the accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

4. **Visualize Results**:
   Use `visualization.py` to generate plots and visualizations of the model’s predictions and performance metrics. This step helps interpret results and assess model effectiveness visually.

## Performance Metrics

Our ensemble model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions the model got correct.
- **Precision**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives, indicating the model's reliability.
- **Recall**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives, measuring the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both concerns.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between different evolutionary outcomes, allowing us to evaluate performance across varying thresholds.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping to visualize performance at a granular level.

### Expected Outcomes
The project aims to achieve high accuracy and robust predictions across various biological datasets, especially related to genetic evolution. By using the ensemble model approach, we expect to improve model reliability and generalization, facilitating deeper insights into evolutionary processes.

## Models Used
