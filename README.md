# Modeling Evolutionary Processes in Complex Biological Systems with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Modeling Evolutionary Processes in Complex Biological Systems with Machine Learning**, aims to simulate evolutionary processes within biological systems using machine learning models. We utilize an ensemble approach, integrating several models to achieve a comprehensive view of genetic variation, trait evolution, and the survival of the fittest.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Modeling Evolution**: To simulate evolutionary processes based on real-world genetic datasets.
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use an ensemble of machine learning models to predict evolutionary outcomes and measure model performance.
3. **Metrics and Performance Evaluation**: Apply various performance metrics to analyze and compare models.

## System Design

This project is structured to efficiently load data, process it, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The models work collaboratively to improve accuracy in predicting evolutionary outcomes based on genetic traits and environmental factors.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - **DataLoader**: Loads and preprocesses datasets, cleans missing data, and splits it into training, testing, and validation sets.
   - **Preprocessing**: Normalizes the dataset and performs feature extraction based on genetic traits.

2. **Model Training**:
   - **Ensemble Models**: We use an ensemble of machine learning models to predict evolutionary patterns and outcomes. The models include:
     - **Random Forest**: A decision-tree-based model for predicting evolutionary success.
     - **XGBoost**: A gradient-boosted decision tree to enhance model accuracy in complex datasets.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: To identify boundaries between evolutionary outcomes.
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Useful in clustering genetic data and understanding local variations.
     - **Neural Network (NN)**: A deep learning model that handles the complexity of high-dimensional genetic data.
   
3. **Evaluation and Metrics**:
   - **Evaluation.py**: This module calculates various metrics to evaluate model performance:
     - **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correctly classified samples.
     - **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: For a deeper understanding of the model’s performance on different classes.
     - **ROC-AUC**: To assess how well the model distinguishes between evolutionary categories (e.g., beneficial vs. non-beneficial mutations).
     - **Confusion Matrix**: For visualizing correct vs. incorrect predictions.
     - **Cross-Validation**: To ensure robustness of the models across multiple datasets.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Visualization.py**: Plots graphs such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and trait distribution over time to provide insights into model performance and the evolutionary trends.
   
5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - **GridSearchCV**: Used to optimize model parameters, ensuring the best possible performance for each model.
   
6. **Ensemble Voting Mechanism**:
   - The ensemble model combines predictions from all models to improve the overall prediction accuracy by taking a weighted vote from individual models.

## Performance Metrics

Our ensemble model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions the model got correct.
- **Precision**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives.
- **Recall**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between different evolutionary outcomes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Expected Outcomes
The project aims to achieve high accuracy and robust predictions across various biological datasets, especially related to genetic evolution. By using the ensemble model approach, we expect to improve model reliability and generalization.

## Models Used
We integrate several models to form a powerful ensemble:
1. **Random Forest**
2. **XGBoost**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Neural Networks (NN)**

These models are carefully chosen to balance between interpretability and predictive power, ensuring that we can explore the complexity of evolutionary processes in a robust manner.

## Future Enhancements

- **Incorporating More Advanced Deep Learning Models**: Such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) for deeper insights into genetic structures.
- **Larger Datasets**: Working with more comprehensive datasets from global repositories to enhance model accuracy.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Adding functionality to process real-time genetic data for evolutionary trend prediction.
